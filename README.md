# TerrCtrl
The QGIS 3 plugin “TerrCtrl”, short for territorial control, which calculates the location and extent of territory controlled by warring parties during civil wars after each combat.
## Installation
There are two ways to install the plugin: 1. search and install from the official QGIS repository; 2. download the folder of source code named territorial_control and place the folder in the following directory: C:/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins 
## To run it
Please refer to the user's guide PDF to kick it off. The test dataset can be found here. The guide also includes download links of input data for most Asian and African countries (you only need to prepare the conflict event GIS data).
