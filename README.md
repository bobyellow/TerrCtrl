# TerrCtrl
The QGIS 3 plugin “TerrCtrl”, short for territorial control, which calculates the location and extent of territory controlled by warring parties during civil wars after each combat.
## Installation
There are two ways to install the plugin: 1. Run QGIS Desktop 3.x with GRASS 7.x, on the menu find “Plugins” → “Manage and Install Plugins" → then search "TerrCtrl" and install it from the official QGIS repository; 2. Download the folder of source code (territorial_control.zip). Run QGIS Desktop 3.x with GRASS 7.x, on the menu find “Plugins” → “Manage and Install Plugins" → "Install from ZIP"  →  Browse and select the downloaded ZIP folder to install the plugin.
## To run it
Please refer to the user's guide PDF to kick it off. The test dataset can be found here. The guide also includes download links of input data for most Asian and African countries (you only need to prepare the conflict event GIS data).
